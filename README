To run, just $ ./chat.py
It will suggest a line you can give to your friends on IRC or email or somewhere else, so you're included in their chatting.

Lines starting in /  are commands. Everything else is sent to your friends.
There are 3 commands
/add - add a friend
/list - list your friends
/ignore - remove a friend

also /help and /quit but those don't do anything special

Note for debugging purposes non-friends sending you stuff will still pop up
indicators.

/ignore IP
will remove IP from your friends list. Just copy and paste a line from /list or
w/ev. IP:port will ignore the port part.

/add IP:port
IP is an IPv6 cjdns address
port is an integer, doesn't matter just depends whatever their chat's listening on.

/list - list your friends
